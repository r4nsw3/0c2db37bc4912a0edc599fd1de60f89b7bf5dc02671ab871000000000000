  |   Update Notes: v1.6.1 (v589824). Firmware 9.0.1 and master key 7.0     |
  |   are required.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Bug Fixes                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Udonna's Frost Orb no longer causes permanent freeze when hitting   |
  |     the opponent during their pre-jump state                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Quantum Ranger no longer soft locks the game when he's thrown by    |
  |     Jason                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Magna Defender's OTG state after his wall bounce hit reaction now   |
  |     behaves consistently                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Tommy, Drakkon, Udonna: projectile limitations are now correctly    |
  |     applied and cannot be bypassed with crouch input                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Jason                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Neutral Special (counter) no longer has any super armor             |
  |     post-counterattack, due to its new mechanics and utility            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Kat Manx                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Standing medium hitstun reduced from 33 to 28, with its cancel      |
  |     window moving up 2 frames earlier, mitigating the effectiveness     |
  |     of specific ground loop combos                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Standing heavy hitstun reduced from 35 to 30 frames                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Magna Defender                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed a specific hit reaction with EX attack; it now guarantees     |
  |     the follow-up ground bounce and no longer puts the victim into a    |
  |     backwards spinning knockdown (after using up all ground bounces,    |
  |     for instance)                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Mastodon Sentry                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue with forward Special (mine) spawning a mine in       |
  |     mid-air if certain hurtbox conditions are met                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Forward Special (close range, button tap) startup reduced by 1f     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Ranger Slayer                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue with chaining from nocked high arrows (standing      |
  |     medium); you can now cancel this attack into standing heavy,        |
  |     instead of standing heavy 2                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue with nocked forward Special (rising knee): hitbox    |
  |     and frame data is now consistent with its normal version            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Nocked forward + medium (slayer rain) now has OTG properties        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Udonna                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Ice Spike projectiles (forward Special) can no longer spawn         |
  |     outside of the arena, making it much more reliable in corner        |
  |     combos. Damage has been slightly reduced                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Super now causes a crumple hit reaction, allowing for follow-up     |
  |     attacks. Damage has been reduced                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Neutral Special (Frost Orb) juggle limiter penalty reduced          |
  |     significantly, but is now limited to one per combo (second Frost    |
  |     Orb hit causes air reset), allowing for lengthier combos off of     |
  |     stray Frost Orb hits                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Crouching heavy now has OTG properties (limited spinning            |
  |     knockdown)                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Shadow Ranger                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed a specific rear hitbox issue with neutral Special > H ("For   |
  |     Isinia!"), that extended Shadow's hurtbox way behind him against    |
  |     certain projectiles                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Quantum Ranger                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue with Evasive Gambit > L ("Up Here" teleport)         |
  |     airblock animation playing incorrectly                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Quantum Power crouching heavy (launcher): added a launch            |
  |     limitation to mitigate effectiveness of specific loop combos        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Known Issues                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Certain beam projectiles can be reflected by Shadow Ranger's        |
  |     forward Special and Goldar's back heavy                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * While on 2P side (on the right side, facing left), calling an       |
  |     assist while the opponent is KO'd can cause the assist to face      |
  |     the incorrect direction. To be fixed in the next update             |
